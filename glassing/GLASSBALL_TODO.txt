Tired of landing and seizing planets that you do not want?
This mod allows you just to glass it into ruins!

After 80% bombardment of a planet, you can choose whether to glass it or nuke it. Glassing makes a planet no longer colonizable.

Feature:
After a indiscriminate or armageddon bombardment and the devastation of the bombarded planet is above 80%, you can choose to
1. Glass the planet for 600 energy. remove all creatures from the planet, and make the planet into an uncolonizable dead world forever. This can be reversed with a console command (planet_class [class])
2. Nuke the planet for 200 alloys and 200 minerals which removes all creatures and turns the planet into a tomb world.
3. Continue bombardment

TODO:
1 re-colonizable a glassed planet.
